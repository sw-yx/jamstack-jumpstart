# Welcome!

There are a few things you'll need to get setup for today:

1. A laptop with the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.
1. An IDE or text editor like VS Code
1. A terminal
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. (Optional) [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) CLI (like npm's CLI, but better. You may find some bugs go away when using yarn's module resolution.)
1. (Optional) A free [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account
1. (Optional) Netlify CLI: `npm i -g netlify-cli`

## Questions

Feel free to ask questions at any time! My style is pretty off the cuff so I'm happy to stop and go down the roads we need to.

## What to Expect From Today

Today we are going to learn about the JAMstack and build a few JAMstack sites with Gatsby. We are going to cover:

1. Intro to Gatsby and Gatsby Themes (30 mins)
1. Exercise I: Build your new blog (15 mins)
1. Guided: Gatsby Plugins (and Gatsby Image and Lifecycle) (15 mins)
1. Intro to Netlify and JAMstack (30 mins)
1. Exercise II: Deploy your new site and add serverless functions (15 mins)
1. Add Fauna DB (15 mins)

## These Notes

These notes aren't comprehensive - more of a landing spot to grab the code if you get stuck. We will try and code as much of the code by hand, but if you misspell something or misplaced a curly bracket, feel free to grab the code from the notes or from the finished files.

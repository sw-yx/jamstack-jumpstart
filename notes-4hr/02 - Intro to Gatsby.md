# Intro to Gatsby

## Starter Files

Gatsby provides a number of starter projects on their site. [You can see them here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2).

I am providing you a few starter files, including a `package.json` detailing all the packages we need for today.

Go ahead and cd into `site` and run `npm install`.

Then to start our application we type `npm start`.

## Questions

Feel free to ask questions at any time! My style is pretty off the cuff so I'm happy to stop and go down the roads we need to.

## Gatsby 101

So, what is Gatsby? It's a framework for creating websites with `React.js`. Gatsby is considered a "_static site generator_" which means that before you put your website up online, you run a build command that will compile your website into a set of HTML, CSS and JS (React) files.

This makes your website extremely fast. But Gatsby isn't _just_ another static site gen; it's much more than that.

Gatsby makes it easy to build a website with all of today's best practices at the forefront, _not_ an after thought. This includes code splitting, pre-loaded routes, image loading and compression, offline ready and so much more. Along with amazing user experiences, the gatsby developer experience is fast, hot-reloaded and easily deployable.

### Pages + Routing

At its core, Gatsby has pages. You know what pages are, right? Want a page called `/about`? Make an `about.js` and export a React component.

Gatsby also includes a Router, which by using their `<Link to="/about">About</Link>` component, will allow you to both pre-load that page as well as use HTML5 pushstate to change the page without a browser reload.

Gatsby also includes a set of APIs for dynamically creating pages &mdash; more soon.

## Exercise: Creating Pages

So, let's make sure we have things up and running!

Let's make a new page called `index.js` and `about.js`. These pages just need to default export a React component (any type will do)!

```js
// index.js
import React from "react"

export default function HomePage(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the home page</p>
    </div>
  )
}

// about.js
import React from "react"

export default function AboutPage(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the about page</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now you can see your pages at `localhost:8000`.

> Tip: What if someone typo's your url? In development, Gatsby provides you a default 404 page, but you can also make a `src/pages/404.js` custom 404 page.

## Layout

Gatsby doesn't have a prescribed way of creating layouts like Next.js has `_app.js` and `_document.js`. It's just regular ol' React components on a page.

Let's go ahead and make a `components/layout.js` component.

> Tip: Unlike `src/pages`, `src/components` isn't a "magic directory". You can name it whatever you like.

At it's simplest it looks like this:

```js
// src/components/layout.js

import React from 'react'

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Website!</h1>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now import that component into your pages and wrap your pages in it:

```js
// index.js

import Layout from '../components/layout'
// ...
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <p>I'm the home page!</p>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

## GraphiQL and Site Metadata

Now we really shouldn't hard code the data in out `layout.js`. So we can put all this data in a config file.

In the root of your project you have a `gatsby-config.js` file. We will use this for configuring all our data sources and plugins in the future, but for now, we can also store site metadata.

```js
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    anything: 'I want',
    title: `JAMstack Jumpstart`,
    description: `Kick off your next, great Gatsby project with this default starter. This barebones starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need.`,
    author: `@swyx`,
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

On most sites, we would just import this config and be done with it. But because gatsby is a a static site generator, Gatsby needs to be aware of the the data.

Restart your application (`Ctrl + C` && `npm start`) and then open up the Graphiql interface at http://localhost:8000/__graphql

We can run queries in this playground to see this data:

```graphql
query {
  site {
    siteMetadata {
      title
      anything
    }
  }
}
```

Now how do we get this data into our `layout.js`?

Queries!

There are two types of queries in Gatsby

1. **Page queries**: can be _dynamic_ but can _only be done inside a page_
2. **Static Queries**: can be _done anywhere_, but have the limitation of _not being dynamic_. More on this when we hit images!

To perform a query inside a component, first import a few things inside of `Layout.js`:

```js
// Layout.js

import { graphql, useStaticQuery } from 'gatsby'
```

and then inside our component, just before the return, we can run the query:

```js
const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
  query SiteData {
    site {
      siteMetadata {
        title
      }
    }
  }
`)
```

We can then swap out that hard coded h1 with this:

```js
<h1>{data.site.siteMetadata.title}</h1>
```

> Tip: For older version of React and Gatsby, there is also a <StaticQuery> render prop component to do the same thing. But there's no reason to use it if you can `useStaticQuery` ðŸ˜Ž

## <Link> and Static Routing

Next, we have Routing.

We have two pages: `/` and `/about`.

Let's make a nav component which we can inject into our layout.js

```js
// layout.js

import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'gatsby'

export default function Nav() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

Now you can click around your nav like a regular single page app.

Gatsby Link component is the most common way to move from one page to another. It accepts a few props including `to`, `activeClassName` and `activeStyle`.

[Take a look at the docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/linking-between-pages/) and answer a few questions:

- How to I programmatically change pages?
- how do I style the active page?
- How do I pass state from one page to another?

## Exercise

1. Make two more pages: a 404 page, and one other page
1. Make a footer component with your name and the current year in it.
1. Style the current page to be coloured differently
1. Extract your Nav to be a reusable component
1. Figure out how to do animated page transitions

## Bonus: SEO

Great SEO is a fantastic reason to adopt Gatsby. Nothing is friendlier to search engines than fast, pregenerated HTML. To give the right metadata for each page, we use [`react-helmet`](https://npm.im/react-helmet).

The default Gatsby template provides an `SEO` element you can use, so just go ahead and import it and specify your page title:

```js
// index.js
import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'gatsby'

import Layout from '../components/layout'
import SEO from '../components/seo'

const IndexPage = () => (
  <Layout>
    <SEO title="Home" />
    <h1>Hi people</h1>
    <p>Welcome to your new Gatsby site.</p>
    <p>Now go build something great.</p>
    <Link to="/page-2/">Go to page 2</Link>
  </Layout>
)

export default IndexPage
```

Feel free to read the docs of `react-helmet` and study the source code of `SEO` to see how it works.
